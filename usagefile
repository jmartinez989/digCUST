Usage: digCUST.sh [options] "search term". The options can be in any order and can come before or after the search term (which
is usually the account number of the customer but can be a regular expression). Below are the options available:

    -h or -help or -? (spelling for -help can be just -h or -he or -hel or -help and mixing case is allowed)
        Displays this usage message. If you use this option all other arguments are ignored not matter what order they are
        supplied. Also note that providing any of the below options without providing a search term will default to displaying
        this usage message as well.
    -csv (this flag is case insensitive so can be -csv or -CSV or -Csv etc...)
        Flags digCUST to display output in raw csv format for a customer vrf. This will expect that the search term
        is a valid vrf tag (must be an exact match, vrf tags are case sensitive).
    
    -private:[vrftag]
        Flags digCUST to search the database with the given ip and vrf tag (you will need to use the actual vrf tag in
        place of [vrftag]). This will allow the use of RFC1918 routes.

*RFC1918 routes are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16
